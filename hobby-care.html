       <h4><li><strong>Water:</strong> Mbunas should be kept in freshwater with a pH of 7.5-9.0, a water hardness from 10-20 dH, and a temperature between 75-81Â°F</li>
        <li><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Herbivore Mbunas are compatible with other herbivore Mbunas, Lake Tanganyika Herbivores (Tropheus), and Lake Victoria Haplochromis</li>
        <li>They are aggressive and territorial and you need to keep lots of them, so a large tank is a must</li>
        <li>Feed your Mbuna cichlids 2-3 times a day, but only give them what they can eat within a few minutes.</li>
        <li>The African cichlid is an easy fish to breed. Males fertilize the eggs and the female fish incubates the eggs in her mouth for 3 to 4 weeks, until hatching</li>
        <li>Some common Mbuna cichlids include Genyochromis, Labidochromis, Labeotropheus, Melanochromis, Pseudotropheus, and Iodotropheus</li>
        <li>To replicate their natural environment in an aquarium, a set-up rich in rocks, hides, and caves is ideal.</li>
        <li>Opt for a sandy substrate to best mimic Mbuna cichlids natural environment. This allows them to burrow and forage without injury</li>
        <li>Mbuna cichlids types make some of the most popular species of fish in the aquarium hobby because they are extremely colorful and active.</li>
