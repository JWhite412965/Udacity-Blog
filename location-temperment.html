                    <li>Lake Malawi formed in a valley where the African tectonic plate is in the process of
                        splitting
                        in two</li>
                    <li>It is the fifth largest fresh water lake in the world by volume, the ninth largest lake in
                        the
                        world by area—and the third largest and second deepest lake in Africa</li>
                    <li>Lake Malawi is home to more species of fish than any other lake in the world, including at
                        least
                        700 species of cichlids.</li>
                    <li>The lake also attracts hippos, baboons, warthogs, many species of birds, and occasionally
                        even
                        elephants</li>
                    <li>Area: 11,429 mi²</li>
                    <li>Length: 360.4 mi</li>
                    <li>Width: 46.6 mi</li>

                    <li>Mbuna cichlids are known for being territorial and aggressive fish. They are also highly
                        intelligent and can recognize their owners and other fish in their environment.</li>
                    <li>For their size they are one of the most aggressive fish out there</li>
                    <li>Mbuna are hardy, easy to keep, easy to breed, and widely available.</li>
                    <li>Mbunas are not schooling fish, but they are best kept in groups of 4 or more. You should
                        never
                        keep Mbunas in couples</li>
                    <li>The are many different temperments among the hundreds of different species of Mbuna, most
                        being
                        territorial causing their aggression.</li>
