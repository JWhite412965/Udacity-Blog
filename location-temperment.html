                            splitting
                            in two</li>
                        <li>It is the fifth largest fresh water lake in the world by volume, the ninth largest lake in
                            the
                            world by area—and the third largest and second deepest lake in Africa</li>
                        <li>Lake Malawi is home to more species of fish than any other lake in the world, including at
                            least
                            700 species of cichlids.</li>
                        <li>The lake also attracts hippos, baboons, warthogs, many species of birds, and occasionally
                            even
                            elephants</li>

                            intelligent and can recognize their owners and other fish in their environment.</li>
                        <li>For their size they are one of the most aggressive fish out there</li>
                        <li>Mbuna are hardy, easy to keep, easy to breed, and widely available.</li>
                        <li>Mbunas are not schooling fish, but they are best kept in groups of 4 or more. You should
                            never
                            keep Mbunas in couples</li>

                            being
                            territorial causing their aggression.</li>
