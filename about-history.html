            <h2>About Mbuna Cichlids</h2>
             <h4><li>Mbuna cichlids live in Lake Malawi, the 9th largest lake in the world</li>
                 <li>Mbuna cichlids eat aufswuch, which is mostly algae and small invertebrates and crustaceans that live in the algae</li>
                 <li>Mbuna cichlids have a digestive system that is twice as long as most other fish</li>
                 <li>Mbuna cichlids prefer to dwell in rocks or caves, which is similar to their natural habitat</li>
                 <li>When given hard, alkaline water and a healthy tank environment, Mbuna cichlids typically live for 8-10 years</li>
                 <li>Cichlids can range in size from 2.5 cm (1 in) to 1 m (3 ft) in length</li>

            <h2>Mbuna and their Bloodline</h2>
            <h4><li>The oldest cichlid fossils are only about 45 million years old. That leaves about 90 million years of cichlid history unaccounted for</li>
                <li>The fossil record is spotty, so it seemed possible that older cichlid fossils just hadn't been discovered yet</li>
                <li>Lake Malawi contains a flock of >500 species of cichlid fish that have evolved from a common ancestor within the last million years,
                    Of that Mbuna consist of 13 genera and over 300 species</li>
                <li>Lake Malawi cichlids exhibit spectacular diversity in trophic morphology, including specialist algal scrapers, planktivores, insectivores,
                     piscivores, paedophages, snail crushers, and fin biters</li>
                <li>Mbuna cichlids are maternal mouthbrooders, which means that they lay eggs that are taken into the female's mouth to be incubated, hatched, and then spat out as fry.</li>
                <li>Cichlids entered Malawi via its tributaries, with two tribes — the tilapiines and the haplochromines — taking up permanent residence there</li>
