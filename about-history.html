                <h4>
                    <li>Mbuna cichlids live in Lake Malawi, the 9th largest lake in the world</li>
                    <li>Mbuna cichlids eat aufswuch, which is mostly algae and small invertebrates and crustaceans that
                        live in the algae</li>
                    <li>Mbuna cichlids have a digestive system that is twice as long as most other fish</li>
                    <li>Mbuna cichlids prefer to dwell in rocks or caves, which is similar to their natural habitat</li>
                    <li>When given hard, alkaline water and a healthy tank environment, Mbuna cichlids typically live
                        for 8-10 years</li>
                    <li>Cichlids can range in size from 2.5 cm (1 in) to 1 m (3 ft) in length</li>

                    <li>The oldest cichlid fossils are only about 45 million years old. That leaves about 90 million
                        years
                        of cichlid history unaccounted for</li>
                    <li>The fossil record is spotty, so it seemed possible that older cichlid fossils just hadn't been
                        discovered yet</li>
                    <li>Lake Malawi contains a flock of >500 species of cichlid fish that have evolved from a common
                        ancestor within the last million years,
                        Of that Mbuna consist of 13 genera and over 300 species</li>
                    <li>Lake Malawi cichlids exhibit spectacular diversity in trophic morphology, including specialist
                        algal
                        scrapers, planktivores, insectivores,
                        piscivores, paedophages, snail crushers, and fin biters</li>
                    <li>Mbuna cichlids are maternal mouthbrooders, which means that they lay eggs that are taken into
                        the
                        female's mouth to be incubated, hatched, and then spat out as fry.</li>
                    <li>Cichlids entered Malawi via its tributaries, with two tribes — the tilapiines and the
                        haplochromines
                        — taking up permanent residence there</li>
