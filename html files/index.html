                        in Lake Malawi.
                        The name "mbuna" means "rockfish" in the language of the Tonga people of Malawi. Most mbuna live
                        among the rocks and along the rocky shores of Lake Malawi</li>

                    <li><a href="about-history.html">Genome:</a> Lake Malawi contains more than 500 species of cichlid
                        fish that have evolved from a common ancestor within the last million years
                        Mbuna cichlids are a popular group of cichlids from Lake Malawi. When given hard, alkaline water
                        and a healthy tank environment, mbunas typically live for 8-10 years</li>

                    <li><a href="hobby-care.html">Hobby Care:</a> Mbuna are very aggressive and territorial fish, they
                        are not suitable for beginner fishkeepers. A suitable aquarium setting includes many rocks,
                        adequate filtration, caves, and hiding places;
                        plants may be uprooted, so they are best avoided, but a small number will work well in the
                        aquarium</li>
